# FashionGAN - Generative Adversarial Network for Fashion Image Generation

This project showcases the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow for generating realistic fashion images. The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset, and the README provides a step-by-step overview of the key components and processes involved.

## Project Highlights:

- **Data Import and Visualization:**
  - Utilizes TensorFlow Datasets to import the Fashion MNIST dataset.
  - Visualizes a subset of the dataset to gain insights into the images.

- **Dataset Preprocessing:**
  - Performs data transformations, including scaling images between 0 and 1.
  - Sets up a TensorFlow dataset pipeline with features like caching, shuffling, batching, and prefetching for efficient training.

- **Neural Network Architecture:**
  - Constructs a GAN architecture with a generator and discriminator.
  - The generator uses dense, reshape, upsampling, and convolutional layers.
  - The discriminator employs convolutional and dense layers.

- **Training Loop:**
  - Defines custom training steps for both the generator and discriminator.
  - Optimizes the model using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss.

- **Performance Review:**
  - Plots and reviews loss curves during training.
  - Provides insights into the model's learning progress.

- **Image Generation:**
  - Tests the trained generator to generate new fashion images.
  - Visualizes and saves the generated images.

## Usage:
- Clone the repository.
- Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
