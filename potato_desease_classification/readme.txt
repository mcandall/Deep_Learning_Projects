# Potato Disease Classification

This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying potato diseases based on images. The model is trained on the Plant Village dataset, which includes images of healthy and diseased potato plants.

## Key Features

- **Dataset:** Utilizes the Plant Village dataset with images of potato plants.
- **Model:** Built using TensorFlow, the model employs convolutional neural networks for disease classification.
- **Training:** The model is trained on the dataset, and training results, including accuracy and loss curves, are visualized.
- **Inference:** You can run predictions on sample images using the trained model.
- **Saving Model:** The model is saved for future use.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/potato-disease-classification.git
   cd potato-disease-classification
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib
   ```

3. **Explore the Notebook:**
   Open the Jupyter notebook `Potato_Disease_Classification.ipynb` to delve into the code, visualize results, and run predictions.

4. **Train Your Model:**
   If you have a new dataset, adapt the code to train the model on your data.

5. **Customization:**
   Feel free to customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, or adapt it for other plant disease classification tasks.
